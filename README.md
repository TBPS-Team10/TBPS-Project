# TBPS Project

## Getting started
There is an example Jupyter notebook that goes through the process of loading a set of toy data and fitting  to that data available on the blackboard page and the TBPS site. There is also an introductory video that goes through this notebook and breaks it down, that can be found in the "Introductory Lectures" folder on blackboard.
