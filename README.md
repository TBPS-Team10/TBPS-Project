# TBPS Project

## Getting started
There is an example Jupyter notebook that goes through the process of loading a set of toy data and fitting  to that data available on the blackboard page and the TBPS site. There is also an introductory video that goes through this notebook and breaks it down, that can be found in the "Introductory Lectures" folder on blackboard.

To run the notebook locally, you can download this entire repository by clicking [here](https://github.com/TBPS-Team10/TBPS-Project/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). You can then unzip this archive and open the file: `resources/starter_notebook.ipynb` using Jupyter notebook from Anaconda, or using another IDE. Make sure you have the right packages installed to run the notebook - the easiest way to install the missing packages is using the "Environments" tab of Anaconda navigator. Alternatively, you can use the environment provided in the resources folder by running `conda env update -f environment.yml` to load the environment and `conda activate tbps-env`to activate it.
