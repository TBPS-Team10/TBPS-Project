# Data Directory
This folder should contain all of the data given to us for the project. Please download all of the data files from Box using the link in the Teams channel and extract all of the CSV files into this folder. They should be automatically ignored by Git.

An example of how to load from this data directory is shown [here](https://github.com/TBPS-Team10/TBPS-Project/blob/main/src/example.py).
