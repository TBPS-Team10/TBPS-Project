## Join the GitHub Organisation 
You first need to create a GitHub account at [this link](https://github.com/join). You can either use a personal email address or your uni one, and you can claim benefits for free through Imperial at the [GitHub student developer pack](https://education.github.com/pack).

Once you've created an account, send a message to me (Lucas) on either WhatsApp or Discord with the email address that you used for your GitHub account and I'll add your account to the organisation which will grant you access to the repository for the project.
